A Python automated script designed to monitor the prices of specific products on the Takealot platform.
The script has been configured to trigger a Graphic User Interface (GUI) notification when the prices of the identified goods fall below the predetermined threshold.
The GUI provides real-time information on the current prices of the monitored products and includes a convenient option to initiate the purchase of these goods directly through the interface.
This solution aims to enhance efficiency in monitoring and procuring products from Takealot, ensuring timely actions are taken when favorable pricing conditions arise.
